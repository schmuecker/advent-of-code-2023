Thank you for sharing your code. I've reviewed it, and there are a few potential issues and areas for improvement:

1. **Handling Words with Embedded Numbers**: Your `convertNumberStringToDigit` function replaces number words with their digit equivalents. However, this might not work as expected if a word contains a number word within it (e.g., "twone" would become "21e"). This could lead to incorrect parsing of digits in some cases.

2. **Handling Zero**: The challenge doesn't specify how to handle "zero" or if it's even present in the input. If "zero" is a possibility and should be converted to "0", you'll need to add this to your `convertNumberStringToDigit` function.

3. **Error Handling in `getFirstAndLastDigit`**: Your `getFirstAndLastDigit` function returns `-1` if the first or last digit is not found. This could potentially skew your final sum. You may want to handle this differently, perhaps by skipping lines that don't have both a first and last digit.

4. **Regular Expression in `getNumbersInString`**: Your current regular expression `/\d/g` only finds individual digits. If the calibration values can have more than one digit (e.g., "twelve" should be 12), you'll need a more complex regular expression or a different method to handle these cases.

5. **Testing Edge Cases**: Make sure to test your code with a variety of inputs, including those with no numbers, only one number, numbers at the beginning and end of a line, and lines with multiple numbers.

To improve your code, consider the following steps:
- Modify `convertNumberStringToDigit` to handle complex cases like embedded number words.
- Add handling for "zero" if required.
- Adjust the error handling in `getFirstAndLastDigit` to better suit the requirements of your problem.
- Ensure `getNumbersInString` can handle multi-digit numbers if necessary.
- Add thorough testing for various edge cases.

Once you make these changes, test your program again with the provided inputs and see if the output matches the expected results. If you need further assistance or have specific questions, feel free to ask!

To fix the first issue, where words with embedded numbers might be incorrectly parsed, we need to update the `convertNumberStringToDigit` function. The main challenge here is to replace whole words representing numbers without affecting parts of other words. To achieve this, we can use regular expressions with word boundaries (`\b`) to ensure that we only replace whole words.

Here's an updated version of the `convertNumberStringToDigit` function:

```javascript
function convertNumberStringToDigit(word) {
  let newString = `${word}`;
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\bone\b/g, "1");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\btwo\b/g, "2");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\bthree\b/g, "3");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\bfour\b/g, "4");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\bfive\b/g, "5");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\bsix\b/g, "6");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\bseven\b/g, "7");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\beight\b/g, "8");
  newString = newString.replaceAll(/\bnine\b/g, "9");
  return newString;
}
```

In this version, the `\b` in the regular expressions ensures that we only match whole words. For example, `\bone\b` will match "one" but not "alone" or "bone".

This change should address the issue of incorrect parsing when number words are embedded within other words. Please test this updated function with various inputs to ensure it works as expected in your specific use case.
